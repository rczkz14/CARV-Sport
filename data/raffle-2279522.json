Levante takes their chance, Valencia doesn't. Classic tale of clinical finishing versus profligacy. Levante's defensive shape breaks down when pressed high up the pitch. Valencia excels at controlling tempo but struggles when forced to be direct. Exhaustion sets in late, leading to defensive lapses and inevitable late goals.\n\nThis prediction considers current form, historical performance, key player availability, and tactical matchups. Soccer outcomes can be unpredictable, but this analysis provides a professional assessment based on available data.",
