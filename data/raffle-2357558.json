Houston Rockets's depth at multiple positions wears down Orlando Magic's roster. Houston Rockets's perimeter defense allows too many three-pointers. Orlando Magic's pace dictates tempo and wears out opposing defenses. A blocked shot at the rim with under 30 seconds remaining proves pivotal. Houston Rockets's veteran presence on the bench provides clutch plays.",
