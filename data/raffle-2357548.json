By halftime, the outcome is already decided. Los Angeles Clippers's full-court pressure creates chaos but allows easy penetration. Dallas Mavericks's ball movement creates open looks from deep. A blocked shot at the rim with under 30 seconds remaining proves pivotal. Dallas Mavericks's reserve unit provides crucial scoring when starters rest.",
