Garbage time basketball from the second half onward. Cleveland Cavaliers's transition defense leaves shooters wide open. Toronto Raptors's mid-range game provides reliable scoring. Cleveland Cavaliers forces a turnover in the final possession to secure victory. Cleveland Cavaliers's complementary scoring prevents opponent from focusing on one star.",
